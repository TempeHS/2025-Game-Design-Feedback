Canvas Crawler

Description:

Canvas Crawler plunges players into a chilling, adrenaline-fueled quest through a haunted house teeming with danger and mystery. As Hibikasu, a determined operative on a high-stakes mission, players must navigate through the level chambers to locate three treasure chests (the code for collection system has not been added yet). Armed with a sword and being able to shoot fireballs, Hibikasu must fend off ghosts and venomous spiders that guard the house’s secrets. I have not yet been able to add enemies as well as this was one of my biggest issues. I could not find proper tutorials that would let me add a health bar or be able to take damage from enemies. Every tutorial on youtube was different and i was unable to find the one suited to my game. The game blends fast-paced combat with strategic exploration, demanding quick reflexes and sharp decision-making. With every gem collected and enemy defeated, Canvas Crawler draws players deeper into its haunted world, testing their courage and skill in a race against time and terror.

Basics of the Game

The controls are simple and responsive — W to move forward, S to step back, Spacebar to jump, M to attack, and K to shoot fireballs. You can also dash by pressing shift. The Code for attacking and shooting fireballs has not yet been implemented so there is no combat in the game for now. 

Dependencies
The game was built to run on windows and the system used to program was unity and visual studio for code.

Problems
There are many problems in my game. These include that I have not fully finished and also the assets made by my partner are very bad, completely just ruining the aesthetic aspect of my game. My game lacks the essential and core aspects of its combat and collection system for chest. My player does not take any damage and i do not have any levels or increasing difficulties.
