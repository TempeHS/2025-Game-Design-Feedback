# Feedback for Axel

## Overall Summary

This is an ambitious and impressive project, Axel. You've created a game, "Shutter," with a unique and complex set of mechanics, including a day/night cycle and a photo-capture system. This is a good achievement that demonstrates your creativity and willingness to tackle advanced programming challenges.

## Assessment Breakdown

### 1. C# Programming Skills

- **What Went Well**: You are not afraid to tackle complex systems, and your `DayTimer.cs` and `PhotoCapture.cs` scripts are good examples of this. It's clear from your code that you are a determined problem solver, and you have a good grasp of organizing code into logical classes.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Your project would benefit from better organization. Creating more subfolders for your scripts (e.g., `Player`, `UI`, `GameManagement`) would make it easier to navigate.

### 2. Extensive Development

- **What Went Well**: The scope of your project is impressive. A photo-capture system and a day/night cycle are features you'd expect to see in an indie game. You've created a sense of a complete and immersive world with multiple scenes and a map system.
- **Areas for Improvement**: You have a huge number of features, but some of them are not fully implemented or polished. It might be beneficial to focus on a smaller set of core mechanics and polish them to a high standard.

### 3. README Documentation

- **What Went Well**: Your `README.md` is well-structured and provides a good overview of your project. Including GIFs to demonstrate gameplay is a good touch. The "Version History & Fixes" section provides valuable insight into your development process, which is a professional practice.
- **Areas for Improvement**: You could improve the "Installing" section by providing a step-by-step process for users who might not be familiar with Unity, or by linking to a pre-built executable.

## Code Feedback

- **Intrinsic Documentation**: Your complex code would be much more understandable with more comments. Explaining the purpose of key variables and the logic of your functions (especially in `DayTimer.cs` and `PhotoCapture.cs`) would be a huge help for anyone trying to understand your work.
- **Code Consistency**: While you have many scripts, they are all in the root `Scripts` folder. Organizing them into subfolders based on their function (e.g., `Player`, `UI`, `CoreSystems`) is a professional practice that improves project maintainability.
- **Syntax and Logic Health**: Your code shows a willingness to tackle difficult problems. The logic within your core systems is ambitious. The next step is to refine this logic, focusing on stability and ensuring all parts of the system work together.
