# Project Title

Dungeon Duel 2P

## Description

This is a two-player fighting game made in Unity where each player controls a unique character with special abilities. The goal is to outsmart and defeat your opponent using timing, strategy, and your character’s powers. It’s designed for local multiplayer, so friends can battle it out side by side. The game features smooth controls, cool visuals, and a fun arena that keeps the action exciting. It’s a great showcase of Unity’s game-making tools and a solid base for adding more features like online play or new characters.

## Game Object

The game object is the character each player controls in the fighting game. It has parts that let it move, jump, attack, and use special moves. It also keeps track of things like health and speed. The character reacts to player input and plays animations like walking or striking. Everything works together to make the character feel smooth and fun to play. It's built using Unity's tools like Rigibody2D for physics and Animator for cool movements.
