# Feedback for Wesley

## Overall Summary

Unfortunately, the project directory submitted for assessment was found to be empty. No game files, scripts, or documentation were present, which made it impossible to evaluate the project.

## Assessment Breakdown

### 1. C# Programming Skills

- **What Went Well**: No C# script files were found in the project directory, so it was not possible to assess this category.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Ensure that all project files, especially the C# scripts located in the `Assets/Scripts` folder, are correctly included in the final submission. Using a version control system like Git can help prevent accidental omissions.

### 2. Extensive Development

- **What Went Well**: No Unity scenes, prefabs, or other assets were found, so the extent of the game's development could not be evaluated.
- **Areas for Improvement**: It is crucial to verify that the entire Unity project folder is submitted for assessment. A complete project includes the `Assets`, `Packages`, and `ProjectSettings` directories. A good practice is to test the submitted project on a different computer to ensure it runs as expected.

### 3. README Documentation

- **What Went Well**: A `README.md` file was not included in the submission.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Project documentation is a critical component of software development. A `README.md` file should always be included to provide an overview of the project, instructions on how to play, and credits for any external assets used.

## Code Feedback

- **Intrinsic Documentation**: No code was submitted, so it is not possible to assess the use of in-code comments or other documentation practices.
- **Code Consistency**: Without any code files, it is not possible to evaluate adherence to naming conventions or consistent code style.
- **Syntax and Logic Health**: No code was available to check for correctness, potential bugs, or logical errors.
