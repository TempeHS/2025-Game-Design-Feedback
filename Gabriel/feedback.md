# Feedback for Gabriel

## Overall Summary

This is a fantastic project, Gabriel. You've created a challenging and engaging platformer, "Conquest," with a great sense of style. The core mechanics are well-implemented, the game is fun to play, and your documentation is a model of clarity and professionalism.

## Assessment Breakdown

### 1. C# Programming Skills

- **What Went Well**: Your code is clean, well-organized, and demonstrates a strong understanding of C# and the Unity API. You've implemented a full suite of modern platformer movement mechanics, including a dash, a wall jump, and a variable-height jump. This is a huge achievement and shows a deep understanding of character controllers.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Your code is very readable, but adding comments to explain the purpose of your variables and the logic of your functions is always a good practice.

### 2. Extensive Development

- **What Went Well**: You've built a complete and playable game with a clear objective and a number of well-implemented features. The player controller is the star of the show; the movement is fluid and responsive. You've also used a variety of assets to create a visually appealing and atmospheric game, with the parallax background being particularly effective.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Your current level is a good start, but it's very linear. Think about how you can use your movement mechanics to create more interesting and varied level layouts. The game could be even more challenging with the addition of enemies.

### 3. README Documentation

- **What Went Well**: Your `README.md` is excellent. It's comprehensive, well-organized, and provides a great overview of your project. You've provided detailed explanations of your game's features and have done a fantastic job of citing your sources. This is a crucial part of academic and professional integrity.
- **Areas for Improvement**: To make your `README.md` even better, you could embed some of the most important code snippets directly in the document, with a brief explanation of what they do.

## Code Feedback

- **Intrinsic Documentation**: While your code is readable, adding comments to explain the logic within your `WallJump` function or your `Dash` coroutine would make it even easier for others to understand your implementation.
- **Code Consistency**: As your project grows, it will be important to keep your scripts organized in subfolders (e.g., `Player`, `UI`, `GameManagement`). This is a professional practice that makes projects much easier to maintain.
- **Syntax and Logic Health**: Your implementation of advanced platforming mechanics like wall jumping and dashing is excellent. The use of coroutines for time-based actions and clear, logical checks for player state (e.g., `isWallSliding`) demonstrates a strong grasp of game programming patterns.
