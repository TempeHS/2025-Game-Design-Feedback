# Feedback for Gabriel

## Overall Summary

This is a functional project, Gabriel. You've created a challenging and engaging platformer, "Conquest," with a good sense of style. The core mechanics are implemented, the game is fun to play, and your documentation is clear and professional.

## Assessment Breakdown

### 1. C# Programming Skills

- **What Went Well**: Your code is clean, well-organized, and demonstrates an understanding of C# and the Unity API. You've implemented a full suite of modern platformer movement mechanics, including a dash, a wall jump, and a variable-height jump. This is a good achievement and shows an understanding of character controllers.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Your code is very readable, but adding comments to explain the purpose of your variables and the logic of your functions is always a good practice.

### 2. Extensive Development

- **What Went Well**: You've built a complete and playable game with a clear objective and a number of implemented features. The player controller is the core of the game; the movement is fluid and responsive. You've also used a variety of assets to create a visually appealing and atmospheric game, with the parallax background being particularly effective.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Your current level is a good start, but it's very linear. Think about how you can use your movement mechanics to create more interesting and varied level layouts. The game could be even more challenging with the addition of enemies.

### 3. README Documentation

- **What Went Well**: Your `README.md` is good. It's comprehensive, well-organized, and provides a good overview of your project. You've provided detailed explanations of your game's features and have done a good job of citing your sources. This is a crucial part of academic and professional integrity.
- **Areas for Improvement**: Your documentation is good. To make it even better, you could add a "Controls" section with a simple table that clearly lists the keybinds for all player actions, such as jumping, dashing, and wall sliding.

## Code Feedback

- **Intrinsic Documentation**: While your code is readable, adding comments to explain the logic within your `WallJump` function or your `Dash` coroutine would make it even easier for others to understand your implementation.
- **Code Consistency**: As your project grows, it will be important to keep your scripts organized in subfolders (e.g., `Player`, `UI`, `GameManagement`). This is a professional practice that makes projects much easier to maintain.
- **Syntax and Logic Health**: Your implementation of advanced platforming mechanics like wall jumping and dashing is good. The use of coroutines for time-based actions and clear, logical checks for player state (e.g., `isWallSliding`) demonstrates a grasp of game programming patterns.
